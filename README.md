# FetchMeHome: A Pet Adoption and Recovery System | MERN Stack 
"FetchMeHome" is a website where you can either adopt or recover pets. If you have a pet you can't care for anymore, you fill out a form to put them up for adoption, allowing others to view their profile and apply to give them a new, loving home. If you've lost your pet, you can report them as missing by submitting their details and last known location, helping others identify and reach out if they've seen them. Similarly, if someone finds a stray pet, they can report it on the platform, increasing the chances of reuniting lost pets with their rightful owners.
